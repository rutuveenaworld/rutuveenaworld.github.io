<b>About the Destination</b>
<br>
Kerala is located on the southwestern Malabar Coast. It came into existence in 1956 after Malayalam speaking regions were reorganized. Kerala was ruled by many dynasties over the centuries, the most notable among them being the Chera Dynasty, the Ay kingdom, and the Ezhimala kingdom. In the latter ages, colonial powers were attracted to this region.<br><br>
