<b>About the Destination</b>
<br>
Manali, a small resort town located in the picturesque state of Himachal Pradesh, has been providing respite from the summer heat of the plains for quite some time now. Once a sleepy hamlet, Manali packages for couples have risen to prominence as they take you to what is now one of the most important hill stations in India.

<b>Best Time to Visit Manali</b>
<br>

Manali is touted to be a destination ‘for all seasons and all reasons’.

However, if you wish to witness snowfall and do some skiing, the winter months (October to February) would be the best.
